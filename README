Grail interface
---------------

This is an extremely rudimentary interface between Grail 0.3b1 and PIL
0.1.  Among other things, it doesn't work for inline images.

Put the pil_interface.py module somewhere where Grail finds it, and
copy the image_tiff.py module into the filetypes subdirectory.

To handle other file formats, just copy the image_tiff.py file to,
say, image_jpeg, image_gif, image_bmp, image_ppm, image_sgi,
image_sun, image_pcx, image_xbm, etc... (and make sure to change the
class name within the file as well).

Hopefully, future versions of Grail will let me register multiple
formats with a single module, and use the same code for inline images
as well.
